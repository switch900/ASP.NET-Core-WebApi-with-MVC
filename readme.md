The assignment uses .NET Core 3.0 to create a WebAPI which calls GoogleApis.com/books and builds a database using Entity Framework of Harry Potter books. The client side is a MVC app which uses individual user authentication.   Registered and logged in users can view the results of the Harry Potter Books as a list on the mainpage.  Each item is a clickable link which allows the user to view a detailed page of the selected item.  

Everything is deployed to Azure so the SQL database, API and Client App are run from Azure.  For the purpose of marking this was live but the Azure page has since been deactivated due to cost.
